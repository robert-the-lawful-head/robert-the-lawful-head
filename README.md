### 🧭 About Me

I build AI systems that scale.  

Over the past decade, I’ve deployed production-grade LLM pipelines, engineered resilient cloud-native architectures, and led cross-functional teams delivering critical AI/ML capabilities to healthcare, fintech, and enterprise clients.  

My specialty lies at the intersection of **AI Engineering**, **DevOps**, and **Infrastructure Architecture** — ensuring that models don’t just perform well in a notebook, but deliver value in the real world.  

If it involves **LLMs, MLOps, Kubernetes, observability, vector search, or multi-cloud architecture**, I’ve probably built it (and optimized it).

### ⚙️ What I Do

✅ Architect and deploy **LLM-powered platforms** using LangChain, RAG, and Transformer models  
✅ Design scalable, observable **AI/ML pipelines** with MLOps best practices  
✅ Engineer **secure, multi-cloud infrastructure** (AWS, Azure, GCP) with Terraform and Kubernetes  
✅ Lead development of **microservices & APIs** (FastAPI, Node.js, .NET Core, gRPC)  
✅ Optimize **real-time AI inferencing** using Triton, TorchServe, and Vertex AI
